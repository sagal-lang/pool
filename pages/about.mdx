# About
Sagal is a programming framework born from my long-standing passion for both linguistics and software engineering.
After many years of programming, I have come to realize its influence on my thinking has not only honed my technical skills but also made me quite articulate in other aspects of life.
While programming and the dev-stacks we use may have their drawbacks, as Dijkstra once said:
> The tools we use have a profound and devious influence on our thinking habits, and therefore on our thinking abilities.

Working through various projects, I find it intriguing that the way I structure my thoughts is shaped by the syntactic rules of the tools I use, rather than the tools adapting to my way of thinking.
This realization led me to embark on a journey with two questions in mind:
- What if programming could follow the structure of meaningful, human expressions as seen in natural languages?
- Can human expressions precisely meet the level of computational accuracy required by machines in programming? 

Sagal seeks to answer these questions by offering a framework designed to capture the natural flow of thought while ensuring the precision required in programming.
It is built on a collection of linguistic ideas, drawing from the belief that:
> Just as letters combine to form words, grammatical particles are the letters of semantics.

Whether you view it as a framework, formal grammar or a programming language, Sagal is still evolving. 
For a quick glimpse into the vision, feel free to check out my recent article [here](https://open.substack.com/pub/amoallim/p/the-grammar-of-code-a-framework-inspired?r=16dgo0&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web).
Stay tuned, as I will continue to break down these ideas in a more structured manner.
In Sagal, I aim to:
- Define rules and heuristics to distinguish between [grammatical particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_particle) and content words.
- Establish a core set of grammatical particles.
- Define primitive content words as abstractions for instructions, entities, and data types, which are necessary for an arbitrary programming language to function.
- Build a toy programming language (simple English) as a proof of concept.
- Incorporate querying features into the language as declarative operations.
