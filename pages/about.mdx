# About
Sagal is a programming framework born from my long-standing passion for both linguistics and software engineering.
After years of programming, I don't know a better way to put this, but programming has made me quite articulate in life. 
Despite having its negative impacts, as Dijkstra once said:
> The tools we use have a profound and devious influence on our thinking habits, and therefore on our thinking abilities.

I find it intriguing that the way I structure my thoughts is shaped by the syntactic rules of the tools I use, rather than the tools adapting to my way of thinking.
This led me to ask two essential questions:
- What if tools could follow the structure of meaningful, human expressions?
- And what if human expressions could directly provide the precision machines require?

These are the questions Sagal seeks to answer‚Äîa framework designed to reflect the natural flow of thought while maintaining programming precision.
While speaking multiple languages, my view on linguistics led me to believe:
> Just as letters combine to form words, grammatical particles are the letters of semantics.

Whether you view it as a formal grammar or a programming language, Sagal is still evolving. 
For a glimpse of my vision, you can read my recent article [here](https://open.substack.com/pub/amoallim/p/the-grammar-of-code-a-framework-inspired?r=16dgo0&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web), but stick around as I break down these ideas in a structured way.
In Sagal, I aim to:
- Define rules and heuristics to distinguish between [grammatical particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_particle) and content words.
- Establish a core set of grammatical particles.
- Define primitive content words as abstractions for instructions, entities, and data types, which are necessary for an arbitrary programming language to function.
- Build a toy programming language (simple English) as a proof of concept.
- Incorporate querying features into the language as declarative operations.
