# About
Sagal is a programming framework born from my long-standing passion for both linguistics and software engineering.
After many years of programming, I find it intriguingâ€”and at times frustratingâ€”that my problem-solving mindset has been so deeply shaped by the tools and frameworks I use as a developer.
Whether it's the logical flow of structured systems or the rigid frameworks I work with, I often catch myself applying these patterns to life's messier, more abstract problems, even when they don't really fit.

As Dijkstra wisely noted:
> The tools we use have a profound and devious influence on our thinking habits, and therefore on our thinking abilities.

This realization set me on a path to answer two fundamental questions:
- What if programming could follow the structure of meaningful, human expressions as seen in natural languages?
- What if human expression could be formalized to precisely describe the computational accuracy required by machines?

Sagal represents my attempt to answer these questions. 
Itâ€™s a framework designed to blend the intuitive expressiveness of language with the technical demands of machine logic.
Built on a collection of linguistic ideas and grounded in the belief that:
> Just as letters combine to form words, grammatical particles are the letters of semantics.

Whether you see it as a framework, formal grammar, or a programming language, Sagal is still evolving. 
For a quick glimpse of the big picture, check out my recent article [here](https://open.substack.com/pub/amoallim/p/the-grammar-of-code-a-framework-inspired?r=16dgo0&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web).
In Sagal, I aim to:
- Define cross-linguistic rules and heuristics for identifying [grammatical particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_particle).
- Establish a core set of grammatical particles.
- Define primitives for instructions, entities, and data types, which are necessary for an arbitrary programming language to function.
- Build a toy programming language (simple English) as a proof of concept.
- Incorporate querying features into the language as declarative operations.
