## The Vision
What if the language we use to program computers could speak the language of human thought?
Imagine coding not just as a technical skill, but as an art form‚Äîone where the ability to convey a single, precise meaning through a few lines of code mirrors the elegance of a well-crafted sentence.

#### Why It Matters?
Traditional programming langauges often prioritize machine execution over the expression of meaning, making it hard for developers to convey the intent behind the code.
Built on a foundation of linguistic theory, Sagal introduces a novel approach that aligns code with the natural flow of thought and language.
By prioritizing meaning over syntax, it transforms programming into an intuitive process, allowing developers to express their intent clearly, while ensuring that machine behavior faithfully adheres to the semantics of human communication.
