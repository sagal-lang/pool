## The Vision
What if the language we use to program computers could speak the language of human thought?
Imagine coding not just as a technical skill, but as an art form‚Äîone where the ability to convey a single, precise meaning through a few lines of code mirrors the elegance of a well-crafted sentence.

#### Why It Matters?
Traditional programming languages often prioritize syntax over meaning, creating a gap between human intention and machine execution, while burdening developers with navigating the abstract complexities of syntactic rules and machine behavior.
Built on a foundation of linguistic theory, Sagal introduces a novel approach that streamlines these challenges by aligning programming with natural language, using grammatical particles to construct precise, unambiguous semantics.
This makes coding more intuitive, turning every line of code into a deliberate, meaningful interaction, transforming how we communicate with machines through programming.

## Getting Started
Begin with the Documentation to uncover the core philosophy, linguistic foundations, and architecture behind the framework.
For a detailed breakdown of the grammar and semantics that power Sagal, visit the Specifications section. 
Lastly, visit the About section to learn more about the project‚Äôs background.
