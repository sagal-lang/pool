# Clauses

## Introduction

A clause is the fundamental building block of the Sagal framework, akin to sentences in natural language and expressions or statements in existing programming languages.
Just as sentences convey complete thoughts in language, clauses in Sagal define self-contained, executable logic.

In this document, we will explore how clauses are constructed and composed within Sagal, using `YAML` for structural representation.
We will also draw analogies to natural language, with code examples from `Python 3.11` and `Scheme R7RS` to illustrate key concepts.
